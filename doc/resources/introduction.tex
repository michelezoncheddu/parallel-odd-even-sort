\section{The problem}
Odd-even sort is a sorting algorithm derived from bubble sort. It alternates two phases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item in the odd phase, every element in an odd position is compared to its following, and if the first is larger to the second, the two are swapped;
    \item in the even phase, the same approach applies to the even positions.
\end{enumerate}
The algorithm goes on until two consecutive phases end without any swap.
